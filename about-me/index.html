        About Mythical Trashcan
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I am a solo developer who knows a few programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those programming languages are: (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bash) and I am currently learning (Lua and Java)
    </p>
    <p>
        I work hard on what I do and always like to figure out solutions to problems when related to tech.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am sure I am the smartest at my school since many others don't understand this, so called "magic" I have.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a friend at school currently who I really like to talk to. Even though he may think he is as smart as me, he just hasen't seen what I have to do to be where I am.
    </p>
    <p>
        My friend and I both enjoy tech and work well together. We make sure we both can learn from each other as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, kids at school call me a computer nerd. I go by many interesting names. Those being (Igor, Mr. Devious, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, I am rather young. I won't reveal the age or school I go to, but I will say that I am still in middle school.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy making videos for YouTube, but am temporarly on a break, so that I can upgrade my PC to work well for videos.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used to have an Eaglercraft server that over time was shutdown, but I decided to create a new one using 1.8 instead and made it 10x better than the last. (You can find this server at the projects list on the main page.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this had no plan the become a real setup for my life and things going on, I may just come here and update this based on life changes. (Ex: No longer in middle school)
