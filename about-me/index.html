            Hi, I am a solo developer who works with a few programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those programming languages are: (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bash, Lua and Java) and I am currently trying to improve in all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I work hard on what I do and always like to figure out solutions to problems that I encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel I am the smartest at my school since I see a huge gap from my skills and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began developing an interest in programming almost 6 years ago and actually started programming 3 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend and I both enjoy tech and work well together. We make sure we both can learn from each other in any way possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kids at school call me a computer nerd and I go by many interesting names. Those being (Igor, Mr. Devious, etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I am rather young. I won't reveal the school I go to, but I will say that I am a freshman at a High School.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just got out of Middle School recently and am looking for others like me at the High School
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to have an Eaglercraft server that over time was shutdown by the Middle School IT Admins (They told me to close it because they didn't know what to do).
        </p>
        <p>
            Since this had no plan the become a real setup for my life and things going on, I may just come here and update this based on life changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am someone who doesn't like restrictions so I decided to make a site to play games. I make sure I get my work done first before the games.
        </p>
