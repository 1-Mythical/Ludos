            Hi, I am a solo developer who works with a few programming languages.<br><br>

            Those programming languages are: (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bash, Lua and Java) and I am currently trying to improve in all of them.<br><br>

            I work hard on what I do and always like to figure out solutions to problems that I encounter.<br><br>

            I feel like one of the smartest computer programmers kids in my school.<br><br>

            I began developing an interest in programming almost 6 years ago and actually started programming 3 years ago.<br><br>

            I am rather young. I won't reveal the school I go to, but I will say that I am a freshman at a High School.<br><br>

            I just got out of Middle School recently and am looking for others like me at the High School.<br><br>

            I used to have an Eaglercraft server that over time was shutdown by the Middle School IT Admins (They told me to close it because they didn't know what to do).<br><br>

            I am someone who doesn't like restrictions so I decided to make a site to play games. It is always fun sharing my own website with others and them not even knowing I made the whole thing.<br><br>
